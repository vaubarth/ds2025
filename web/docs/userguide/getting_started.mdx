# Getting started

## Installation

Download the `ds` binary from the GitHub releases. Unpack it and move it to your binary folder.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
        ...
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
        ...
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="mac" label="Mac">
        ...
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

When running `ds` for the first time it will prompt you for some input and create a configuration profile.

```bash
ds

> Whats your name?
> Whats your GitHub username?
> Thats it, now run 'ds auth' to authenticate with dsenv
```

After that you will need to run `ds auth`. This will open a browser window where you need to login with your DS account.
