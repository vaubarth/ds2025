# Observability

Our observability stack is built around [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).
Ingesting data is done via [Alloy](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/) to respective databases.

We provide storage and analysis for:
- Unstructured log data
- Metrics and time-series
- Telemetry and traces

 subgraph dssys["NS: DSSys"]
        blueprinter["Blueprinter"]
  end
  subgraph o11y["NS: O11y"]
        dashboard["Dashboards"]
        ingest["Ingest"]
  end
 subgraph cB["NS: Customer B"]
        cBw1["Webapp 1"]
        cBw2["Webapp 2"]
  end
 subgraph cA["NS: Customer A"]
        cAw1["Webapp 1"]
        cAw2["Webapp 2"]
  end
 subgraph k8s["K8s"]
        dssys
        o11y
        cB
        cA
  end
    o11ydb["O11y DB"]
    o11ydb@{ shape: cyl}

    cBw2 --> ingest
    cAw1 --> ingest
    cAw2 --> ingest
    cBw1 --> cBw2
    
    o11y --> o11ydb

    blueprinter --> o11y

```

## Usage

Every services gets a pre-configured ingest pipeline for all support types of data.
We create a dashboard per service that includes all vital metrics.

Additionally we setup alerts for common scenarios.
Every team needs to extend their dashboards and alerts to their actual use-cases.
Important features should have their own observability.
