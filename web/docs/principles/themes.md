# Themes

`dsenv` and all its components follow the following themes:

## Predictable
It is clear how things work. When you do something twice, you get the same result. Processes just make sense.

## Easy
Processes and tools fit in your workflows. They are well documented and do what you need them to. You can focus on the outcome, not the steps. Great UX and an ease of use make using the tools second nature.
We always think about the user as a customer. How can we add automation with the lowest possible friction. Manual steps should be completely avoided. At the same time there always needs to be an easy way to trigger something manually if needed.

## At your fingertips
Whatever you need, you have it within your reach. Information is right there when and where you need it. There are no interruptions by looking things up in different places. Everything is just there.
We aim to treat any automations like a coworker commenting on a PR or in slack. No need to dive into menus or find the right button. When something fails we leave a prominent comment where it reaches our developers.
It is tempting to describe actions that users need to take up front. However this creates a lot of mental load as developers need to hold all the information in their head.
