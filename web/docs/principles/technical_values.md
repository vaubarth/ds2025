# Technical Values


## Standards Enhanced
- Use standards, don't reinvent the wheel
- Add value. Make everything seamless and tailored to the work at hand
- We integrate into the tools developers use everyday

## Engineering Practices

- Everything we do follows proper software engineering practices
  - Every tool is well tested and has CI
  - Every tool has its own documentation
- We ship single binaries or docker containers
  - Except for docker, no dependencies should be needed on a system
- Every process is documented in text and as a diagram

## Composable workflows
- Create individual, small tools
  - We favor CLIs over complex GUIs
  - Every tool is designed to be integrated into larger flows
  - 
## Transparent Abstraction
- Tools hide complexity behind abstractions but are transparent when needed
